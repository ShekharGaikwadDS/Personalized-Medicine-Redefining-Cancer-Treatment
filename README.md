# Personalized-Medicine-Redefining-Cancer-Treatment
Understanding the genetic mutations that really matter in a cancer tumor is a really challenging task with a potential huge impact on millions of lives.
Cancer is one of the most dangerous disease. As there is cure for some types of cancer it is very costly and all humans cannot afford it. So diagnosing the cancer in early stages itself is the best thing we can do. So this project is about classify the different types of cancer using different machine learning algorithms.
